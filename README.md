- 👋 Hi, I'm @VickyWebDev, an aspiring web developer.
- 👀 I'm passionate about web development, and I use TypeScript to build robust and scalable React applications.
- 🌱 While my frontend is powered by TypeScript, I'm also learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) for my backend development.
- 📚 I'm actively learning and building web projects, combining the power of TypeScript in React with the capabilities of the MERN stack for my backend.
- 🤝 I'm open to collaborating with fellow learners and developers to work on exciting web development projects.
- 📫 Feel free to connect with me at webdevelopervignesh@gmail.com to share ideas, learn together, or simply chat about web development!

<!-- Keep coding, keep learning, and let's build the web together with TypeScript in React and the MERN stack! -->
